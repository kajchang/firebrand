          <br>Historical Note: In many state (Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Caorlina, South Carolina, Virginia) this was a position elected by the State Legislature rather than by popular vote.

One commissioner is elected from each of the six Levy Court districts and one commissioner is elected at large. These commissioners represent the governing body of the county and hold weekly business and committee meetings which are open to the public.<br/>
