This website displays results from the [Trueskill](https://trueskill.org) algorithm on historical American election returns.

### Data Sources

Gathering comprehensive, high-quality data is the hardest element of the project.

All of the data is collected semi-automatically from these sources with minimal editing:

- [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org)
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
- [Dave Leip's Presidential Election Atlas](https://uselectionatlas.org)

I also recently found a high-quality data source, [Our Campaigns](https://www.ourcampaigns.com), that I'm going to look into using to extend and replace some low-quality data.

Other relevant resources I ended up not using:

- [MIT Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/)
- [FEC Election Results](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/electionresults.shtml)
- [The OpenElections Project](https://github.com/openelections)
