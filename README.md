This website displays results from the [Trueskill](https://trueskill.org) algorithm on historical American election returns.

### Data Sources

Gathering comprehensive, high-quality data is the hardest element of the project.

Most of the data was collected semi-automatically from these sources:

[Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org)

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)

[Dave Leip's Presidential Election Atlas](https://uselectionatlas.org)

I also recently found a high-quality data source, [Our Campaigns](https://www.ourcampaigns.com), that I'm going to look into using to extend and replace some low-quality data.
